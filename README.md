### Progressbar

This plugin display a progress bar on your wiki. The progress is defined by the integer number.

The first type, you can use the percentage, that a number between 0 to 100

> `<progress=87>`

or you can use two number divide style

> `<progress=34/105>`

the first number should be smaller than the second one, and both of them should be integer.
